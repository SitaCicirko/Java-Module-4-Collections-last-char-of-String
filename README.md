# Java-Module-4-Collections-HashSet orders
Imagine a situation where code written by a third-party developer turns out to be storing duplicate values for online store orders. 
As a result, sometimes two products are sent instead of one.

From what is known, the developer used an ArrayList to store order numbers. Is this a good idea?

Your job is to do your own implementation of order number storage.
Be sure to check if your solution allows you to store duplicate values!
